## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series,
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should
explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should
also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try
to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review
and merge.

It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was
the purpose? Why does it matter to you? Does it resolve any known Github issues?
Adding a line "resolves #" (e.g. "resolves #23") to the description of your pull
request or of a specific commit will automatically close this issue once the
pull request is merged.
